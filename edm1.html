<p>Worldâ€™s largest modularized ethylene cracking furnace has been successfully 
  delivered from our fabrication yard in Zhoushan, China. The furnace is designed to produce 
  200,000 tons of ethylene per year, weighing 3,689.6 tons with 53.31 meters in height. 
  It only took 150 days from inception of modularization design to completion of assembly.
